## Installation
Copy this repo and load it up using a code editor like Visual Studio Code. You will need Node.js installed to use this, as well as your own Inquirer version 8.2.4 due to the files being ignored by the gitignore file. Also possibly Jest, if you want to run the tests.

## Usage
Begin by navigating to the terminal where the main contents were saved and running "node index.js" and then follow the prompts. To initiate the tests, simply type "npm test"
